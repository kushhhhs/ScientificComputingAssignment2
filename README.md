# SciCompGroup8
Scientific Computing course assignments. Group consist of: Liesbet Ooghe, Frederieke Loth, Kushnava Singha

# Contents
simulation.py - Contains DLA Simulation Implemented with SOR
dla_notebook.ipynb - This notebook runs the code neccesary for answering part A of the Assignment
gs_class.py - Contains the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model class.
gs_visual.py - Contains all neccesary visualisation functions for the Gray-Scott model.
gray_scott.ipynb - This notebook allows the user to view the generated Gray-Scott model for different parameters as plots and animations.

# Requirements
The code was run on Python 3.12 
Libraries Numpy, Matplotlib, Numba and Scipy

# Usage
By running the gray_scott.ipynb you can run the neccesary code for the Gray-Scott model. Please note that some cells may run for longer than 1 minute.

# Results
After running the simulations, you can visualize the results as animations or plots of concentration fields for Gray-Scott. 

# Conclusion
This project aims to simulate Diffusion Limited Aggregation, the MonteCarlo DLA Model and the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion Model.
